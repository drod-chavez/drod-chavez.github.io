# drod-chavez.github.io

Hello, my name is Dani. As a busy university student, I haven't had time to explore other interests of mine. But, I've finally decided to bite the bullet and design my own website here on Github. As someone who is beginning this project with limited knowledge of how building websites work, I provide all of my resources below that have helped me along the way.

### Resources
1. http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/

This website helped me first set up my site, instructing me what original files I need to have and then giving me resources so that I can go off and explore other sites using Jekyll and how to make my site (and skills) better.
