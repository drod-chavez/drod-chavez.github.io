# drod-chavez.github.io

Hello, my name is Dani. As a busy university student, I haven't had time to explore other interests of mine. But, I've finally decided to bite the bullet and design my own website here on Github. As someone who is beginning this project with limited knowledge of how building websites work, I provide all of my resources below that have helped me along the way.

### Resources
1. http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/

This website helped me first set up my site, instructing me what original files I need to have and then giving me resources so that I can go off and explore other sites using Jekyll and how to make my site (and skills) better. 
   
2. https://henrik.nyh.se (source code: https://github.com/henrik/henrik.nyh.se)

This website and the source code helped me figure out how to add pages that *weren't* blog posts, since I'm not particularly interested in having a blog. It was also cool to start to understand what the layouts were and how to use the various files to create the style of the page (both font wise and heading/footer wise).

3. https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites

I found the website from point 2 from the above website. It has a lot of websites using Jekyll, as well as the source code for them so you can explore what all the possibilities are. 

4. https://html.com/wp-content/uploads/html-cheat-sheet.pdf

As I start to write up my web pages, this cheat sheet has been very helpful in figuring out what commands I need to use for what.
